== Overview ==

Cargo is an extension to MediaWiki that provides a lightweight way
to store and query the data contained within the calls to templates, such
as infoboxes.

The extension defines the following parser functions:

* #cargo_declare - placed within the <noinclude> part of a template; it
defines the schema for a table.

* #cargo_attach - also placed within the <noinclude> part of a template;
specifies that a template adds rows to a table declared elsewhere.

* #cargo_store - stores one row to a Cargo table; usually placed within
the <includeonly> part of a template.

* #cargo_query - queries one or more Cargo data tables, using SQL
components.

* #cargo_compound_query - calls multiple queries, and displays the
results together.

* #cargo_display_map - displays a map showing a single point.

* #recurring_event - outputs a string holding a list of dates for a
recurring event, for use by #cargo_store.

Although the Cargo extension does not make use of Semantic MediaWiki, and
in fact can be considered an alternative to it, it still fits within the
same family of extensions that take a data-centric approach to MediaWiki.

If possible, please add "[Cargo]" at the beginning of the subject line, to
clarify the subject matter.
